Any SSL certificates you put in this directory in pem format with file
names ending in ".pem" will be considered valid. You can append
multiple certificates in a single file, and you can include site
certificates and CA certificates (certificate authorities).

File names of the PEM files should not contain periods, except in the
trailing ".pem". So use "billstclair-com.pem", not
"billstclair.com.pem". Maybe I'll fix this one day, but not today.

The pem files are loaded only once, the first time you do something
that requires connection to a Loom server. To add more certificates,
you'll need to restart the Truledger process.

In a development image, you can cause a reload with:

  (setf truledger-client::*ssl-certificates-initialized-p* nil)
