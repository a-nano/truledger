I have only tested Trubanc with CCL version 1.3. Get that from:

  http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl

Or MacPorts has it, for the Macintosh. I've tested 64-bit OSX and
64-bit FreeBSD. I'll ensure soon that it works on Linux and Windows.

Once "ccl", typed from a shell prompt, starts CCL, you're ready to
proceed.

Assuming $TBDIR is your trubanc directory, do the following to start a
lisp, and build and load Trubanc:

  cd $TBDIR
  ./trubanc

If you add a port, it will load slime and start it listening on that
port:

  ./trubanc 4005

To load the slime distributed with Trubanc into your emacs, assuming
the "trubanc" dir is in your home directory, put the following in ~/.emacs:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/trubanc/systems/slime/")
  (require 'slime)
  (slime-setup '(slime-repl))

Then you can do m-x slime-connect, and direct it to localhost and the
port you specified when you started trubanc, e.g. 4005.

If you use another version of slime, you can fairly easily modify the
"trubanc" script to use that one instead of the one in the Trubanc
archive. Or just start your slime with m-x slime, and load
"trubanc-loader.lisp" from the REPL, or load the trubanc-loader.asd
system with ASDF.
