I have tested Truledger with CCL versions 1.3 through 1.5. Get CCL
from:

  http://ccl.clozure.com/

Or MacPorts has it, for the Macintosh. I've tested 64-bit OSX, 64-bit
FreeBSD, 32-bit and 64-bit Linux, and 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.

Once "ccl", typed from a shell prompt, starts CCL, you're ready to
proceed.

Assuming $TLDIR is your truledger directory, do the following to start a
lisp, and build and load Truledger:

  cd $TLDIR
  ./truledger

If you add a port, it will load slime and start it listening on that
port:

  ./truledger 4005

If you set the TRULEDGER_PORT environment variable, a web server for
the Truledger client will be started on that port:

  TRULEDGER_PORT=8080 ./truledger 4005

To load the slime distributed with Truledger into your emacs, assuming
the "truledger" dir is in your home directory, put the following in
~/.emacs:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/truledger/systems/slime/")
  (require 'slime)
  (slime-setup '(slime-repl))

Then you can do m-x slime-connect, and direct it to localhost and the
port you specified when you started truledger, e.g. 4005.

If you use another version of slime, you can fairly easily modify the
"truledger" script to use that one instead of the one in the Truledger
archive. Or just start your slime with m-x slime, and load
"truledger-loader.lisp" from the REPL, or load the
truledger-loader.asd system with ASDF.
