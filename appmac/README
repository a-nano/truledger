This directory contains bits to create a Macintosh .DMG installer.

The create-dmg script is usually all you'll need. It copies
InfoPlist.strings and the Truledger binary into a mounted copy of
Truledger.sparseimage, then uses hdiutil to convert the SPARSEIMAGE
file to a compressed DMG. It is called automatically from the script
that creates the executable:

  .../truledger/truledger-app

Normally, you just need to edit .../truledger/macapp/InfoPlist.strings
before running the truledger-app script, inserting the current version
number and copyright year(s).


How to create Truledger.sparseimage
===================================

Platypus-4.4.tar.gz is binary for the Platypus app, which can create a
standard Mac application wrapper for a script. Its home page is:

   http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus

To create Truledger.app, start Platypus, and enter the following in
its dialog, after clicking the "Show Advanced Options" triangle:

  App Name: Truledger
  Script type: "Shell" /bin/sh (the default)
  Script path: .../truledger/macapp/truledger-mac.sh (in this directory)
  Output: "Text Window"
  Identifier: com.truledger.Truledger
  Version: x.y.z (whatever it is)
  Signature: TRUL
  Files and folders to be bundled: .../truledger/truledger-dx86cl64

Uncheck "Remains running after initial execution".

Click create and save as "Truledger" in this directory. Double click
the resulting "Truledger.app" to ensure it works. Then delete the
file:

  Truledger.app/Contents/Resources/truledger-dx86cl64

And copy the file:

  .../truledger/macapp/truledger.icns

over:

  Truledger.app/Contents/Resources/appIcon.icns

That changes the icon from the Platypus icon to the Truledger
icon. You may have to duplicate Truledger.app to get the new icon to
show up. It appears to be cached somewhere.

To create or edit truledger.icns, install XCode and use:

  /Developer/Applications/Utilities/Icon Composer.app

I used Seashore to create dmg-background.xcf, and export it as
dmg-background.png. You can use any image editing program you like. It
needs to have room for the Truledger.app and Application directory
alias icons, in whatever size you like (I used 256x256), plus whatever
graphics and text you want in addition. It is used as the background
image for the .dmg folder.

Next, create a read-write disk image which we'll use as
a template for the shipped .DMG files, using the ideas in:

  http://mac101.net/content/how-to/how-to-create-dmg-art-for-fancy-application-installations/

Open "Disk Utility".
Click "New Image".
Navigate to the .../truledger/macapp directory and Enter
"Truledger.sparseimage" as "Save as". Enter/select the following:

  Name: Truledger
  Size: Custom... 70MB
  Format: Mac OS Extended (NOT journaled)
  Encryption: none
  Partitions: Single Partition - Apple Partition Map (default)
  Image Format: sparse disk image

Click "Create". This will mount the image on /Volumes/Truledger/.

Open /Volumes/Truledger/ in the Finder
Create a directory and name it "background".
Drag dmg-background.png to that directory.
Open a new Finder window to /Volumes/Truledger/background/
Select the /Volumes/Truledger window
Click the "Options/Show View Options" menu item.
Check "Always open in icon view" and "Browse in icon view" in the
  new view options window.
Select "Picture" for the "Background".
Drag dmg-background.png from the /Volumes/Truledger/background/ window
  to the "Drag Image Here" square near the "Picture" radio button.
You should see the background appear in the /Volumes/Truledger/ window.
In a shell, type:

  cd /Volumes/Truledger
  ln -s /Applications .
  /Developer/Tools/SetFile -a V background

The "SetFile" command makes the background folder invisible.
Drag the Applications folder alias to the appropriate place in the
  right-hand side of the /Volumes/Truledger/ window.
Drag .../truledger/macapp/Truledger.app to the /Volumes/Truledger/
  window, and place it in the left-hand side of the window.
Click the "View/Hide Sidebar" menu item
Resize the window to be just big enough for the background image.
Dismount /Volumes/Truledger/, either in Disk Utility, or from the shell:

  hdiutil detach /Volumes/Truledger

Now test that it works. In the shell:

  cd .../truledger/macapp
  hdiutil convert Truledger.sparseimage -format UDZO -o Truledger.dmg
  open Truledger.dmg

Drag the "Truledger" icon to the "Applications" folder alias, then
open /Applications and double-click the Truledger icon. You should see
a window titled "Truledger" with the text "Can't find
executable". That's because you deleted the executable before creating
the sparse image, as expected. The create-dmg script will restore it
before creating the .dmg file. Click "Cancel" to exit the app, and
move /Applications/Truledger.app to the trash.
