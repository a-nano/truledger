See INSTALL for installation notes.

All the examples in this file assume that you're in the TRULEDGER package.

If you neglected to start the web server when you loaded the code (via
the TRULEDGER_PORT environment variable), you can start it with:

  (truledger-web-server nil :port <port>)

The default port is 8785 ("TRUL" on a phone dialpad). See the code for
other keyword parameters.

To save an executable file:

  (save-truledger-application &optional filename)

Starting that application will start the client web server on the
command-line-specified (or default) port.

After you've started the client web server, you can create a server
keypair, and start the server by following the directions at the
"Server Setup & Maintenance" link on the home page
(http://truledger.com:8080/server.html).
