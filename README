See INSTALL for installation notes.

All the examples in this file assume that you're in the TRUBANC package.

The top-level server startup code needs to find the file "server.cfg"
in the current directory. To create that file:

  (start-config-server "passphrase")

Where "passphrase" is the passphrase you want to use for the bank's
private key.

Then aim your browser at localhost:8000, and specify the database
directory, the WWW directory, containing static html files to display
when to "msg" parameter is given, and the port on which to start the
server. It will create a fresh database, write the server.cfg
file, and startup the server on the port you specified.

After you've done the configuration, you can start the server from
"server.cfg" with:

  (start-server "passphrase")

To save an executable file:

  (save-trubanc-application filename)

Starting that executable will query for a passphrase, look for
server.cfg in the current directory, start a server on the specified
database, www dir, and port, if it's there, or query for the
passphrase again and start a config server if it isn't, or if
something else goes wrong.

This is all still a work in progress, so expect lots of bugs.
