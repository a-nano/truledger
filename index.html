<b>Trubanc in Lisp</b></p>

<p>I'm porting Trubanc from PHP to Lisp. This will make it more
  secure, since it will no longer be necessary to store the bank's
  private key in plaintext in the file system. It will be stored
  encrypted, and the bank manager will enter its passphrase when
  starting the server. It also makes it possible to distribute both
  client and server as a single executable file on Macintosh, Linux,
  or Windows. Plus, Lisp is compiled, which will make it a lot faster,
  though that probably doesn't matter much, since the speed is mostly
  limited by the file system and the crypto.</p>
