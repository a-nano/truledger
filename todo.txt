https connections to client and server.

History has some blank lines. Figure out where they come from. Also
some bad parses.

Add fractional balances to Raw Balance screen.

Add a build timestamp to the bottom of the raw balance page.

Maybe the server should be started by logging in to the client with
the bank passphrase. Then there's no reason for any interaction with
the shell, and we can hide it on windows. Also, this allows the app to
be run with nohup, since it never reads or prints anything. It could
even automagically nohup itself if not run that way.

Then we'd need to be able to stop the server on the Admin page. Start
this by grabbing the timestamp lock.

If you login to the server from a second place, the only way to get
REQ back in sync is the "Resync with bank" link. It should do this
automatically, retrying invisibly. Really need to implement the error
type mechanism that's in the docs.

If you add as administrator account from the "Admin" page, an account
that already has another bank, the tokens are spend to that account,
but the bank isn't added. Or something like that. I had to add the
bank. The contacts appeared then, so something is wierd.

Why is getreq called four times a the end of login?

Bug

Do two spends with the same asset to the same recipient.
Recipient accepts one and ignores the other.
He gets the total of the two, but only one is queued on your inbox.
