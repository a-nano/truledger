https connections to client and server.
  I've got the client starting with SSL.
  Need to query the server with SSL,
  and allow changing of the server URL for that.
  Maybe allow client SSL and server plaintext, but probably not necessary.

Contacts should cross bank boundaries automatically, so you recognize
the same ID at different banks. How to make this efficient? Don't want
to query for all contacts at every bank. Maybe remember a list of
banks for each contact, and when an ID you know pops up in a spend,
add that bank to the list for that contact. A little more client work,
but no extra client <-> server traffic. Will need startup code to move
the contacts directory from each bank to the account.

Test for client accepting cookies. Send a cookie with the login page.
Check for that cookie with the login post. If it isn't there, then
the browser doesn't accept cookies.

Investigate using an SSH tunnel, as root, in a screen session to
forward port 80 to port 8080. Currently shut out on trubanc.com by
firewall. Can't do it there anyway, since port 80 needs to be used by
the web server, but may work on other systems, that don't need Apache
running.

Backup mechanism. Write to log files, which are sent out in chunks to
a backup server, which loads the transactions into its
database. Should be able to disable transactions on the backup serer,
so nobody can do stuff there until enabled.

History has some blank lines. Figure out where they come from. Also
some bad parses.

Add fractional balances to Raw Balance screen.

Add a build timestamp to the bottom of the raw balance page.

If you login to the server from a second place, the only way to get
REQ back in sync is the "Resync with bank" link. It should do this
automatically, retrying invisibly. Really need to implement the error
type mechanism that's in the docs.

If you add as administrator account from the "Admin" page, an account
that already has another bank, the tokens are spend to that account,
but the bank isn't added. Or something like that. I had to add the
bank. The contacts appeared then, so something is wierd.

Why is getreq called four times a the end of login?

Bug

Do two spends with the same asset to the same recipient.
Recipient accepts one and ignores the other.
He gets the total of the two, but only one is queued on your inbox.
