Backup mechanism. Write to log files, which are sent out in chunks to
a backup server, which loads the transactions into its
database. Should be able to disable transactions on the backup serer,
so nobody can do stuff there until enabled.

Need to wrap the pubkeydb, too, or make it somehow use the db, wrapped
or not. Check whether it ever writes to this db. It may not.

Need to have a UI for enabling/disabling backup mode.

======================================================================

Negative spends handled as invoices. Costs two tokens, but no change
to balance. The other guy accepts an invoice as a spend mentioning the
invoice number. Credits the tokens when the invoicer accepts the
spend. Invoicee gets those two tokens if invoicer rejects the
spend. So paying an invoice can't ever cost you tokens. But rejecting
one earns you tokens.

Show the database location on the client screen, unless disabled in server config.

Use Pound or Apache mod_proxy to put server on port 80. Alternatively,
start the process as root, start Hunchentoot, and use SETUID and
SETGID to change to a non-root user.

Change passphrase for private key.
Change server URL, on both server and client.

Hide the command shell in Windows.

1. Create a vbscript file called start.vbs with the following code:
CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run """" & WScript.Arguments(0) & """", 0, False
2. To run your file type: start.vbs <name of file>.bat in a command window.

SERVER CONFIG
=============
New client accounts:
  No restrictions on creating new accounts.
  Allow new accounts with a private key.
  No new account without a coupon.
  Always allow a new account with an existing private key

Coupons:
  Normal: allow coupons and spends to unknown IDs.
  Disabled: Coupons only creatable by specified IDs.

Asset storage fees:
  Limit, 10% default
=============

Asset nicknames

Distinguish intentional from unintentional server errors. Give
backtrace only on unintentional messages. TRUBANC-ERROR.

Sanity check the server URL to make sure that the HTTPS matches that
for the client.

Default the bank URL on the Admin page, to the current URL.

Sometimes it hangs on shutting down the web server.

Server switch to disallow minting of cookies or spends to unknown IDs.
This allows central control over membership.
Add to client "Admin" page.
If disallowed, the check boxes don't appear on the "Balance" page.
Protocol for this should be general:
  (<id>,getprop,<bankid>,<req>,<name>)
  (<bankid>,prop,<bankid>,<time>,<name>,<value>)

Change bank URL from the client "Admin" page.
Client login should query bank for URL, and fix stuff if it's wrong.

History has some blank lines. Figure out where they come from. Also
some bad parses.

Add fractional balances to Raw Balance screen.

Add a build timestamp to the bottom of the raw balance page.

Installation docs.

If you add an administrator account from the "Admin" page, an account
that already has another bank, the tokens are spend to that account,
but the bank isn't added. Or something like that. I had to add the
bank. The contacts appeared then, so something is wierd.

Why is getreq called four times a the end of login?

Bug
---
Do two spends with the same asset to the same recipient.
Recipient accepts one and ignores the other.
He gets the total of the two, but only one is queued on your inbox.
