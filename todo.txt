Still getting balancehash mismatches on transfers between accounts.

Distinguish intentional from unintentional server errors. Give
backtrace only on unintentional messages. TRUBANC-ERROR.

Sanity check the URL to make sure that the HTTPS matches that for the client.

Client displays client build info. Also display server build info.

Default the bank URL on the Admin page, to the current URL.

Don't fill in the "Recipient" field with your own ID. Happens when a transfer
gets an error.

Sometimes it hangs on shutting down the web server.

Contacts should cross bank boundaries automatically, so you recognize
the same ID at different banks. How to make this efficient? Don't want
to query for all contacts at every bank. Maybe remember a list of
banks for each contact, and when an ID you know pops up in a spend,
add that bank to the list for that contact. A little more client work,
but no extra client <-> server traffic. Will need startup code to move
the contacts directory from each bank to the account.

Save/restore contacts, encrypted, to/from the server, merging with
what's there.

Server switch to disallow minting of cookies or spends to unknown IDs.
This allows central control over membership.
Add to client "Admin" page.
If disallowed, the check boxes don't appear on the "Balance" page.
Protocol for this should be general:
  (<id>,getprop,<bankid>,<req>,<name>)
  (<bankid>,prop,<bankid>,<time>,<name>,<value>)

Backup mechanism. Write to log files, which are sent out in chunks to
a backup server, which loads the transactions into its
database. Should be able to disable transactions on the backup serer,
so nobody can do stuff there until enabled.

Change bank URL from the client "Admin" page.
Client login should query bank for URL, and fix stuff if it's wrong.

History has some blank lines. Figure out where they come from. Also
some bad parses.

Add fractional balances to Raw Balance screen.

Add a build timestamp to the bottom of the raw balance page.

Installation docs.

If you add an administrator account from the "Admin" page, an account
that already has another bank, the tokens are spend to that account,
but the bank isn't added. Or something like that. I had to add the
bank. The contacts appeared then, so something is wierd.

Why is getreq called four times a the end of login?

Bug
---
Do two spends with the same asset to the same recipient.
Recipient accepts one and ignores the other.
He gets the total of the two, but only one is queued on your inbox.

Windows needs OpenSSL.
